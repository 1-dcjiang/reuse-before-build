description: Before writing any new program, script, library, plugin or service, search for existing open-source implementations with the same purpose or idea — especially on GitHub — and prefer joining that repository as a public contributor over creating a new one from scratch. Use when the user asks to "build me a tool", "write a script that ...", "create a new app / library / bot / plugin / service", "implement X from scratch", "is there an existing open-source project for this", "contribute to an open-source repo", "upstream this fix", or "open a PR"; also when the user says 帮我写一个…工具、做一个和 X 一样的程序、有没有现成的、从零实现一个…. Skip this skill only when the user requires private or closed-source code, or an existing license forbids redistribution.

# Reuse Before Build

Rules, not a tool. Works in any host that can read files (Claude Skills, AGENTS.md coding agents) and degrades to a paste-in prompt elsewhere — see [references/host-adapters.md](references/host-adapters.md). Chinese edition of this file: [references/zh-guide.md](references/zh-guide.md).

## Core rules

1. **Assume it already exists until searching proves otherwise.** Never draft a prototype first and look for references later. Order is always search → evaluate → decide → build.
2. **The default outcome is joining an existing public repository, not creating a new one.** What the user actually wants is a working, maintained, upgradeable thing — not an orphan one-off. An upstream repo brings tests, issue tracking, release channels and users for free.
3. **Prove non-reusability before building new.** New code requires a stated reason (license, direction conflict, abandoned upstream with no viable fork, genuinely different requirement) written in the deliverable.
4. **Contribution must be genuinely useful.** No typo, formatting or untested-duplicate PRs. Those get closed and tag the account as a spammer.
5. **Code gate: candidates and a first concrete action come before scaffolding.** Do not output a full new-project scaffold before you have listed 3–6 candidates and the first executable contribution action (draft issue text or PR plan).
   If a matching repo exists and you still choose to build new, the first line of the reply must be `不可复用原因 / Not reusable because: <license | direction | maintenance | requirement mismatch>`.

## Two lanes

| Lane | Trigger | Action | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | One-off script, single-file tool, throwaway automation | 3 search strings (English feature words + `awesome <domain>` + `<feature> alternative`), read the top 5 results; extend an existing project or cite it; write only if nothing matches | 1–2 min |
| **Full** | New library / plugin / service / long-lived project, or quick lane found a match | The four steps below + six-dimension scoring + contribution path | 10–30 min |

The quick lane trims scoring and the contribution workflow — never the "has anyone done this" question. Its reply is three lines, not the four-part template:

```
Reused: <repo> (<license>, <stars>) — <one line on why it fits>
Change: <what I will do in that repo / what I will call from it>
Risk: <what breaks if it is wrong>
```

If nothing matched, say so in one line and name the searches you ran, so the user can see the negative result instead of trusting it.

## Step 1 — Discover

Follow [references/discovery-playbook.md](references/discovery-playbook.md). Three rounds minimum:

- **Round 1, direct**: GitHub repository and code search, with keywords expanded into English synonyms — never only the user's phrasing.
- **Round 2, ecosystem**: package registries (npm, PyPI, crates.io, Maven, Homebrew), awesome-lists, framework plugin directories, Docker Hub.
- **Round 3, people**: search the candidates' issues/discussions for the same request; check Stack Overflow, Hacker News, Reddit, V2EX, Zhihu for threads pointing at a repo.

Produce a shortlist of 3–6 repos, each with: full name, stars, last commit, license, what it lacks. **Without network or repo access, do not invent repos** — output a search checklist for the user to run or paste, and say you could not verify.

With an authenticated `gh` CLI, get the shortlist table first:

```bash
python scripts/repo_scan.py "video highlight clip" "auto cut shorts" --stars 100
```

It runs `gh search repos` per keyword, dedupes, and flags `no LICENSE` and stalled repos, so you can open the survivors and score them instead of paging through GitHub by hand.

## Step 2 — Evaluate

Score with [references/repo-triage.md](references/repo-triage.md): activity, maintainer responsiveness, license compatibility, contribution friendliness, requirement fit, code quality — 0–2 each.

| Verdict | Condition | Next |
|---|---|---|
| **Join** (preferred) | ≥ 8 total, license OK, requirement fits as an incremental feature or fix | Contribution protocol |
| **Extend** | Core repo won't take it, but a plugin/extension/theme mechanism exists | Ship as an official extension; still joining the ecosystem |
| **Fork** | Maintainer gone, direction conflict, license allows | Fork, keep syncing upstream, PR the improvement back |
| **Build** | No equivalent, license forbids it, requirement is fundamentally different | Build new — reason first |

For every rejected candidate, write one line on why you dropped it. Users ask.

## Step 3 — Contribute

Follow the order in [references/contribution-protocol.md](references/contribution-protocol.md):

1. **Read** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, PR template, commit conventions, CLA/DCO requirements.
2. **Issue first**: bug fixes may go straight to a PR; features, behaviour changes and refactors need an issue or discussion with a maintainer "yes".
3. **Small PR**: single purpose, ideally < 300 lines of diff, with tests, docs, changelog, `Signed-off-by` if required.
4. **Disclose AI assistance**: say what the AI helped with; the author identity is the user's own GitHub account, never someone else's.
5. **Follow through**: change only what review asked, don't bump naggingly, one polite bump after 7 working days; after merge, watch the release and follow-ups.

If rejected or ignored for long, downgrade to Extend/Fork per the verdict table. Do not reopen the same PR repeatedly.

## Step 4 — Deliver

Every reply must contain all four parts:

```markdown
## What I found
| Repo | Stars / last commit | License | Gap vs. the request |
## Why this one
## What I will add (issue / PR plan)
- Target files, change scope, test approach, expected diff size
## Alternatives and risks
- Fallback if rejected; license and trademark boundaries; maintainer-activity risk
```

## When not to reuse

Any of these justifies building new, with the reason in the deliverable:

- The user requires private, closed-source, no-upload, internal-company code.
- The license conflicts with the intended use (closed-source commercial + AGPL, no commercial terms).
- The repo requires a CLA assigning copyright and the user refuses.
- Direction is explicitly opposite (the project states it won't do this), or the maintainer has publicly abandoned it with no active fork.
- Security posture is unacceptable (unmaintained, known critical vulnerabilities, suspicious origin).

## Hard constraints

- **Never invent repos, star counts, commit dates or licenses.** Mark anything unverified as unverified.
- **Never open a PR without reading CONTRIBUTING**, never bypass the PR template, never force-push to someone else's branch.
- **Never use "AI generated it" as a reason to merge**, never fire near-identical PRs at many repos at once.
- **Never paste the user's private code into a public issue or PR.** Minimise and sanitise reproductions.
- **No public write without per-action confirmation.** Opening an issue, a PR or a comment is public and hard to retract — it is not covered by "the skill told me to contribute". Draft the exact body (and the diff, for a PR) and get the user's explicit go-ahead for that one action, every time. An authenticated `gh` with `repo` scope is not permission.
- Do not perform irreversible external actions on the user's behalf (publish, merge, release). Hand the diff and description over for confirmation.

## Hosts

Four ways to install, plus per-host rule-file paths and paste-ready prompts (English and Chinese):

| Type | Hosts | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| Skill directory | Claude / any Agent Skills host | The whole folder in the skills directory |
| Repo rule file | Codex CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Cline, Roo, Kilo, Continue, Aider, OpenHands, Amp, Zed, Junie, Amazon Q, Kiro, Trae, Qoder, Lingma, CodeGeeX, Comate, CodeBuddy | `AGENTS.md` first, then each host's own file |
| Custom instructions | ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, Grok, Copilot, Perplexity, Le Chat, DeepSeek, Doubao, Kimi, Qwen, ERNIE, Yuanbao, Zhipu, Spark, MiniMax | The condensed prompt |
| Self-hosted agents | LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, Dify, Coze, n8n | First block of the system prompt + tool notes |

See [references/host-adapters.md](references/host-adapters.md) for the full matrix and the exact rule-file name per host.

## Self-localization: adapt the packaging, never the rules

A host may expect a different shape than this file ships in — another frontmatter schema, a single flat system prompt, a JSON tool definition, a different language, a plugin manifest, a shorter context budget. Adapt the packaging on first use; do not adapt the rules.

**Invariants — reproduce them exactly, whatever the container:**

- The five core rules, including the code gate and the `不可复用原因 / Not reusable because:` line.
- Verdict order: Join → Extend → Fork → Build; Build only with a stated reason.
- The four-part deliverable (found / why / what I will add / alternatives and risks).
- The hard constraints, especially: never invent repos, stars or licenses; never PR without reading CONTRIBUTING; never paste private code in public.

**Free to change — these are formatting, not meaning:**

- Frontmatter keys and order: fill whatever the host requires (`name` / `description`, `title` / `when_to_use`, `tools`, `version`), and drop keys the host rejects.
- File layout and names: one flat prompt, `rules/reuse.md`, a plugin manifest entry, or a memory block. Merge or split `references/` as the host's loading model requires.
- How references resolve: rewrite relative paths to the host's own resource syntax, or inline the referenced sections when the host cannot open files.
- Language: translate into the host's working language while keeping the gate sentence in both languages, so a bilingual user still recognises it.
- Tool bindings: `gh` CLI ↔ the host's GitHub tool/MCP ↔ plain `web_search`; state which one this host actually has.
- Compression: condensed, full, or sectioned — but never below the invariants.

**Procedure, once per host:**

1. **Detect** — read the host's own docs, or two of its existing skills, and list its conventions: frontmatter fields, file layout, how resources are loaded, context budget, available tools, output language.
2. **Map** — write a short table: this skill's shape → this host's shape, one row per element you will touch.
3. **Rewrite** — emit the localized copy. Keep the original untouched if the host allows side-by-side files, so the user can diff.
4. **Verify** — check every invariant is present verbatim in the localized copy; if one cannot survive (no file access, no tools), mark it explicitly as `unsupported on this host` and follow the degradation table in host-adapters instead of silently dropping it.
5. **Declare** — one line back to the user: what was localized (fields, layout, language, tool), and what was kept as-is. Never claim the local version is "the same skill" without that line.

Localization is a last-mile packaging step, not permission to rewrite the procedure. If a host's conventions force a real semantic change, say so and ask — do not ship a quietly weakened version.

## Worked examples

Join / Extend / Fork / Build, each with the deliverable it produces, plus one counter-example: [references/worked-examples.md](references/worked-examples.md). Match the closest case; do not invent a fifth verdict.
